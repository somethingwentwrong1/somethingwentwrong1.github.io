###Post about "What are the ways of hackers cracking your computer, why, and how can you defend it?"

The hackers are able to hack into the computer in many ways, but I would like to introduce 3 ways of them. 
First, they can send some links to me as an important site, and if you click it, a troy virus comes into your computer and the hacker can
retrieve all your files depending on the type of the virus. Second, if they are close enough with you, they can open a wi-fi for you to log in.
If you log in, the hacker can see everything you have in your device. Or else, the hacker can use the same wi-fi with you and steal the packages, and
get you information. Third, if they are really close enough to you, they can use a small os device and just plug them in to your pot, and they can
auto run the hacking tool and retreive your files.

The reasons why the hackers do that to you is are as follows: First, they might hate you. They might want you to get into a trouble. Second, they might
want to use your information to earn money or for their benefit. Lastly, they might do it for fun.
  
To defend your devices from them, I recommend you to do what I tell you. First, do not open any suspicious links. Second, do not use any suspicious wi-fi. Third, be aware of your devices, make sure nobody except you really trust touch it.
